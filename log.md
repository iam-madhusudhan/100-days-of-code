# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: December 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Kickstarting the 100DaysofCode today! Solved kata on codewars. Learned some javascript basics. Great start. Eagerly waiting for more challenges in coming days.

**Thoughts:** It's been a little challenging to solve the kata and assimilate the javascript concepts but I'm enjoying it.
